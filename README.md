# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

I will be using the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. This information will include:
- Search bar for finding a city
- Current and future conditions for the city
- Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index
- 5-day forecast

## User Story

```

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN this weather dashboard functions correctly
